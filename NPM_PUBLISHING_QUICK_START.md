   # Choose "Automation" token type
   ```

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/globalbusinessadvisors/llm-marketplace/settings/secrets/actions

## 🎯 Publishing Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended) ✅

**Trigger automated publishing via GitHub UI:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/globalbusinessadvisors/llm-marketplace/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml

2. Click **"Run workflow"** button

3. Select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Version type: `patch` / `minor` / `major`

4. Click **"Run workflow"**

5. Monitor progress in Actions tab

**What happens automatically:**
- ✓ Runs all tests
- ✓ Builds all packages
- ✓ Bumps version numbers
- ✓ Creates git tag
- ✓ Publishes to NPM
- ✓ Creates release notes

---

### Method 2: Release Script (Local)

**For local releases with full control:**

```bash
# Patch release (1.1.0 → 1.1.1)
./scripts/release.sh patch

# Minor release (1.1.0 → 1.2.0)
./scripts/release.sh minor

# Major release (1.1.0 → 2.0.0)
./scripts/release.sh major
```

**What the script does:**
1. Pulls latest from main
2. Runs tests and linters
3. Builds all packages
4. Bumps version numbers
5. Creates commit and git tag
6. Pushes to GitHub
7. Triggers GitHub Actions to publish

---

### Method 3: Manual Publishing (Advanced)

**Only if automated methods don't work:**

```bash
# 1. Login to NPM
npm login

# 2. Verify packages
./scripts/check-packages.sh

# 3. Build everything
npm run build

# 4. Publish all packages
./scripts/publish-local.sh
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Before Publishing

```bash
# Check package configuration
./scripts/check-packages.sh

# Dry run (see what would be published)
npm run publish:dry-run

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

### After Publishing

```bash
# Check if package is live on NPM
npm view @llm-dev-ops/llm-marketplace-sdk
npm view @llm-dev-ops/model-marketplace
npm view @llm-dev-ops/tenant-management
npm view @llm-dev-ops/graphql-gateway

# Install to test
npm install @llm-dev-ops/llm-marketplace-sdk
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "You do not have permission to publish"

**Solution**: Make sure you're a member of the `@llm-dev-ops` NPM organization.

```bash
# Check your NPM username
npm whoami

# Contact org owner to add you to @llm-dev-ops
```

### "Version already exists"

**Solution**: Bump the version before publishing.

```bash
# Increment version
npm run version:patch

# Then publish again
```

### GitHub Actions failing

**Check**:
1. NPM_TOKEN secret is set correctly
2. Token has "Automation" permissions
3. Token hasn't expired

**Re-add token**:
- Go to: https://github.com/globalbusinessadvisors/llm-marketplace/settings/secrets/actions
- Update NPM_TOKEN with new value

### Build errors

```bash
# Clean everything
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
rm -rf */node_modules */package-lock.json

# Fresh install
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
```
